For the moment, comparisons that cross one of these date boundaries will throw a warning that data may be flawed as beat boundaries may have changed; with more time to research the history, analyses can be allowed or disallowed based on whether or not the boundaries of the beat in question changed at the particular time."

The standard deviation of percentage change will therefore be large, and the likelihood of one beat falling outside three sigma by chance will remain small."
