# spd-crimes-vs-villages
SPD crime data comparison before-after visualization and stats for specific beat compared to city as a whole. Designed to look at impact of tiny house villages on neighborhood where they're built, but may be used for other before-after comparisons of SPD reports at a beat level - location data is only provided at beat level, not lat-long to provide privacy and allow more reports to be published (95% with beat vs. 40% with lat-long).
